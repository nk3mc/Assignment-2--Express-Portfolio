    Hello! I’m <strong>Nkem Chukwuemeka</strong>, a second-year 
    <span style="color:#f8ffae;">Networking and Information Technology Security</span> student 
    at Ontario Tech University.

  <p class="text-light">
    I’m deeply passionate about <span style="color:#feb47b;">cybersecurity</span>, 
    <span style="color:#f8ffae;">web development</span>, and building 
    secure, user-friendly applications that make technology both 
    reliable and accessible.

    My goal is to combine technical skills with creativity; exploring how secure systems,
